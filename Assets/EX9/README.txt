There is an issue with exporting this as a package you need to deal with:
- The layers don't export too, so for the wall game objects you need to add and assign them "Ground" layer in the top right of inspector
- The default square sprites may be missing from the all the game objects so in the sprite renderer assign them by pressing the plus next to the sprite variable and searching for the square
