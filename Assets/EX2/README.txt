DO NOT Move/Scale/Rotate any objects in the Scene View, you will be manipulating GameObjects with just code

EX2.0: 
- Make the 2 balls NOT visible in the game view when you start the game
- Each circle should be made not visible in DIFFERENT ways (manipulate different variables)
- (Challenge: try to find a third way)
- Hint: try and manipulate the components on the ball game object in the scene view to see what components can make the circles not visible, then try to recreate those variable values when you start the game

EX2.1:
- Get the red ball into the bucket by just adding 1 new script to ONLY the blue blocks in the scene

EX2.2:
- Same as the previous, but you can ONLY MAKE 2 SCRIPTS for this, you can add them to as many blocks as you want

EX2.3 & EX2.4: 
- Same rules as previous but you can ONLY MAKE 1 SCRIPT for both scenes
- Hint: Think about a common functionality, but with different numbers
