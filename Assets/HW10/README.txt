Saving and Loading HW
- Create a system where it will save the position, rotation, and scale of the objects when I press “S”
- Then I can load those those saved positions, rotations, and scale when I press “L” and all the objects will be set
- (the objects that you will be saving will contain a script call “HW10SaveItem” you are free to edit this script however you want)
- (there will be an object in there that can scramble the position, rotation, and scale called “HW10Scrambler”)
(Make sure you import this in your Midterm Github Repository, same as last assignment, make sure you commit and push it)

Your Final
- Come up with ideas for your final, keep in mind how long it took for your midterm, I will be putting up the details next week!
- Next week I will be talking about a process on turning mechanics into code and I will be asking for some of your game ideas, so if you want your idea to be coded live please bring them in
