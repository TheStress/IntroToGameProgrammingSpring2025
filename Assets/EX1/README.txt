Goal: Create and position/scale/rotate Game Objects with a Rigidbody2D and BoxCollider2D components to get the red ball to the green goal

How to make the game object
- Right click Object Hierarchy then click 2D Object -> Sprites -> Square
- Select the newly created object, in the Inspector add a Rigidbody2D component
- Still selecting this object, in the Inspector add a BoxCollider2D component
- In the Rigidbody2D component you can select Dynamic or Static in Body Type depending on if you want this object to stay still or move
- (you can copy and paste objects in the Object Hierarchy to create new copies)
